I like people who understand me well, but I hate those who understand me too well.
There is a part of me which I just want to be mine; my own little wooden secret box which I dare not open. And then some people just take this box away and break it open in front me. Why! It wasn't even your business!
Please stop it.
Also, die.

Year after year, I've added layer after layer to my facade. And the layers are so thick that it's no more just a mask, it's a goddamn coal mine now. You can get in if you want, but you'll surely get out sweating, choked and smeared with coal dust.

I used to carry my feelings loose, like a professor with his books between classes.
"I carry the books loose for convenience, you see", I would often say, as I would wipe and polish each book cover. The title looks clearer when polished, and I would rearrange the books to put their titles in front.
I still carry them loose. And they still think it's for convenience.

I never understood the long running human fantasy of flying.
What will you get by flying? A sense of thrill? The sheer amount of dirty, oxygen-less air pushing against you as you flap your wings? Or the cliched 'sense of freedom'? Seriously, that's what you'll do with your freedom?
Fly?
Tell that to the bird which is shitting on your window sill right now.

Remember how in love we were?
As if it wasn't just a feeling we shared deep down in bottom of our hearts, but rather a light, that shone bright. But that light soon went from feeling like a warm blanket over us in the winter to being absolutely cruel and piercing our skin with a thousand prickling needles like in the Indian summer.
It caused an explosion so powerful that now we are blinded as we stand in the midst of this universe that resulted because our love failed. We can't even look each...

Remember how we were just water, and we came together to form blood. We imploded into a heart and we beat each day as we explored the path of love. But we went out of sync, and it went from symphony to dubstep to absolute crass cacophony; we couldn't carry it any longer. The heart exploded and now there is blood on our faces, as we stand as the living memorial of our love. We can't even look each other in the eye.
Because tombstones never face each other.

Don't we all feel more secure when we are sad.
We often live our happy moments with a prevalent fear of losing it. But when we are sad, we know things are downhill, and the worse that can happen is it'll go a little south, but still remain downhill.
It's addictive, at times. And it scares me.

Sometimes I feel like a sock.
Like a sock piled with other socks on sale in a supermarket, and people crowded around my lot, tearing each other off to get the right sock. The worst part is that if I land in someone's basket with other groceries, I feel good about myself. As if I am not worthless anymore. And I easily forget that I am supposed to be worn by someone, very soon.
Life stinks. And now it all makes sense.

11 nights. 11 thoughts. Musings of a frustrated, failed writer.
Some thoughts which I could never turn into a poem. Some vexations which I could never vent out. Some thoughts just churned out of other thoughts.

We think memories can be recorded. We stretch out our hands, holding up our phones like a chalice under a waterfall of flowing memories. We easily oversee the fact that memories are not just audio-visual. Memories can be revived, not recorded.
So put down your chalice. For once, bathe in the waterfall.

Those earphones plugged in with loud music and that walk which makes you feel you living behind all the pain and misery, leaving behind this unfair mean world to a better place is all a scam and nothing else.

Why can't one just stop thinking? Just draw a blank and clear one's head of thoughts? I can't, and it's frustrating. It's like sitting in front of a TV switched on.

Look at yourself in the mirror. Aren't you hideous! They tolerated you. Record and listen to your voice. Sounds terrible doesn't it? They listened to you sing cringe worthy songs in this voice. They heard you complain and bitch and rant in that terrible voice with that hideous face.
It doesn't matter if they didn't talk to you for the past few months. If they didn't invite you to their get-together or didn't reply to your messages so promptly.
Call them friends, because deep inside, they still give a shit about you.

punctuation can be so manipulative sometimes as if one is trying to force you to read it in the exact way one will say it to you making you stop and pause at the exact words one wants you to yes it is necessary when you want to get across a larger more strange audience but when you are writing to someone who understands you well shouldn't that person be able to understand the intended punctuation without it being explicitly written can it be a test of how much a person understands the other one

What's the point of bleeding if it does not pain? Because it is not just the pain, it's also the unnerving feeling of life being sucked out of your body, drop by drop, gush by gush. When you feel your veins emptying as the skin parts ways to let the blood out, pain is the last thing bothering you.

I'm pretty sure Bollywood sits down together once a year and decides release dates.
Salman jumps up and calls Eid release.
Aamir calls for a new year release.
Shah Rukh opts for somewhere in between, 'cause by then people would've forgotten Salman and would be waiting intently for Aamir's release.
Akshay proposes his release dates - no gives a f**k.
The remaining dates are taken by YRF and Dharma Productions on mutual understanding.
As for the residual dates... well, who cares.

The kind of calls I've been receiving these days:
Person: Hi Prateekshit, kaun kaun se courses le raha hai?
Me: Hi! Main yeh wale courses le raha hu... <brief explanation> ... tu kaun se courses le raha hai?
Person: ummm.. yaar socha nahi
Socha nahi? Seriously? Even on the last day of registration?
At least don't lie when you're seeking advice.

"A physicist, a biologist, and a statistician go hunting one day. They're creeping around the forest until they come across a deer in the distance, so they crouch down and all three take aim. The physicist is the first to fire but his shot veers off to the left by about 5 metres. The biologist takes his turn and his shot also misses by 5 metres, but this time it goes off to the right of the deer. At this point the statistician yells, "We hit it!""

I am really ashamed that I fell for something so lame, and I apologize to everyone in my friend list who got notifications saying that I had tagged them in a comment.
